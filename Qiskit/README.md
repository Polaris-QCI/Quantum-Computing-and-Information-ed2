## Local Setup

The code is in the form of Python Jupyter notebooks.

You can run the code locally, or in the cloud using one of several Jupyter hosting services.

To run the notebooks locally, we recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage your Python environment.
Follow the instructions for "macOS and Linux" if you are using macOS, Linux, or WSL2.
Follow the instructions for "Windows" if you are using Windows.
You may need to update your `PATH` environment variable to include the location of the `uv` executable.

Once you have `uv` installed, sync the project and create your virtual environment using the following commands:

```
cd Qiskit
uv sync
```

You can run the Jupyter notebooks locally in several ways:

* Using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* Using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
* Using `jupyter-notebook` on the command line.

To use Visual Studio Code or PyCharm, open the project in the IDE and select the virtual environment you created with `uv`.

To use `jupyter-notebook`, initialize the virtual environment first:

On maxOS, Linux, or WSL2:

``` bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

``` powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

On Windows (Command Prompt):

``` cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Then, run the Jupyter notebook server:

``` bash
jupyter-notebook
```

## Cloud Services

You can also run the Jupyter notebooks Cloud-hosted notebook services such as [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Links for each sample for Binder and Colab are below:
